###### What we did

<div style="font-size:10pt;">

- Broke tie between campus review map and smart calendar/task manager (both had 4 stars)
- Decided on calendar because simpler and if you combine stars, people want productivity
- Created text channel on Discord called "pitch" with link to shared Google slideshow

<div style="font-size:10pt;">

- Create slideshow skeleton structure
- Each person pick one or two slides to work on

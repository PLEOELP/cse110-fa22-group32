###### What we have to do

<div style="font-size:10pt;">

- Groups of frontend/backend focus on each workflow (later on in project) once skeleton is done
- Everyone should be familiar with both
- Beginning of project, split things up into "tasks" to do rather than explicit frontend/backend teams.
- Build skeleton together then split have people on specific teams
	- I.e. specific task is chosen and then html/pseudo javascript is written
- Group for scrum master (splitting up tasks)
- Subteams:
	- Scrumming
	- HTML/UX Design
	- CSS/UI Design
	- JS/Backend
	- Documentation (maybe?)
- Group size: 3-4 on specific tasks, and then things inside split by frontend/backend
- Rotations:
	- Discuss later, maybe by teams or rotating between 2 teams? Early is teams by tickets.
- DOC/Design: coding format -> most convenient for everyone
	- Data Storage, style, commenting + docs
		-Ask TA about what is expected for documentation
- CI/CD Pipeline: need to set this up
	- Issue -> Pullrequest -> merge and build?
- Sprint review meeting on 11/14 (swap teams)
- Features:
	- Calendar, To-Do List
		- View Team (what user sees) and then Data Group (storage) -> pick a team
		- Two teams design how app stores/fetches data (JSON is our method for data storage + fetch)
		- Gaugue team work for both to see how much work needed
- Sprint Planning:
	- First Sprint: Nov 2nd (planning out and dividing things up)
- Github Projects: use as sprint backlogs
	- Create events into sprint backlog (as issues)
		- Take issue -> Take it onto its own branch -> Apply to CI/CD
</div>

###### For Next Time
